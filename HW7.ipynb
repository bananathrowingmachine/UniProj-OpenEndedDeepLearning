The data essentially has 3 x variables and a y variable, where the x variables are the algorithm type (with there being 4 types, the Wikipedia solution, one change I made, another change I made, and then both changes combined together), the amount of integers in the set, and the approximate sum of the set and then the y variable is the average amount of iterations each method took to solve the same randomly(-ish) generated set.
